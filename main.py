def load_discography(directory):
    """Gets a directory where 'Pink_Floyd_DB.TXT' is located and loads the discography data into a dictionary:

    We create a nested dictionary structure to store the discography data:

    The main dictionary uses album names as keys
    Each album has 'year' and 'songs' keys
    Each song is a dictionary with 'title', 'artists', 'duration', and 'lyrics' keys


    We open and read the file line by line, parsing each line and adding the data to our structure.


    Finally, we return the parsed discography.


    Parses the text file and structures the data into a dictionary with album names as keys and album details as values.
Each album contains its title, year, and a list of songs.
Each song is a dictionary containing its title, writer, length, and lyrics.

Various functions are implemented to handle the different tasks from the menu:
list_albums(discography)
list_songs_in_album(discography, album_name)
get_song_length(discography, song_name)
get_song_lyrics(discography, song_name)
get_album_by_song(discography, song_name)
search_songs_by_name(discography, word)
search_songs_by_lyrics(discography, word)
Menu Loop:

A loop to display the menu and handle user input, invoking the appropriate function based on the user's choice.

        We do not parse the data in the file, we just read it line by line.


    example data from 'Pink_Floyd_DB.TXT':
        #The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn::1967
        *Lucifer Sam::Syd Barrett::03:07::Lucifer Sam, Siam cat
        Always sitting by your side
        Always by your side
        ...
        That cat's something I can't explain
        *Matilda mother::Syd Barrett::03:07::There was a king who ruled the land
        His majesty was in command
        With silver eyes the scarlet eagle
        ...
        Let's go into the other room and make them work.
        #A Saucerful of Secrets::1968
        *Let There Be More Light::Waters::05:38::Far, far, far away - way
        People heard him say - say
        ...

    As you can see: line starts with '#" -> new album, '*" -> new song, the rest -> new line in a songs lyrics
